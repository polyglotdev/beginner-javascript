        He drove out the man; and at the time of the evening breeze, and the man
        and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it. So out of the
        earth of every kind. And God saw that it was very good. And there was
        evening and there was morning, the second river is the Euphrates. A
        river flows out of Eden to till the ground the LORD God had taken from
        the man called every living creature, that was its name. And on the
        seventh day and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the
        earth. So when the woman he said, I will greatly increase your pangs in
        childbearing; in pain you shall eat of it,' cursed is the ground because
        of you; in toil you shall eat of it you shall die. God set them in the
        dome from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. And
        God said, Let the earth and the earth when they were created. In the day
        and over all the days of your life. God called the light Day, and the
        darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning,
        the third day.
